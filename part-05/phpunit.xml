PHPUnit Configuration
=====================
This is a PHPUnit configuration file that contains
a number of useful defaults. I use this in many of
my projects. Feel free to steal it!

All tests located within the 'tests' directory will
be executed.

<phpunit backupGlobals="false"
         bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php"
         colors="true"
         processIsolation="false"
         stopOnFailure="false"

    <testsuites>
        <testsuite name="tests">
            <directory>tests</directory>
        </testsuite>
    </testsuites>
</phpunit>
